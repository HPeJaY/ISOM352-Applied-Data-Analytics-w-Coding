    "Store best score information in a dictionary with keys: 'player_name' and 'num_guesses'\n",

    "File Structure: Store data as simple text format (e.g., \"Alice,7\" for name and guesses)\n",
    "Missing File: When FileNotFoundError occurs, create initial dictionary with high guess count\n",
    "Dictionary Usage: Create functions that accept and return dictionaries for best score data\n",
